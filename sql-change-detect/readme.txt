Simple demonstration of change detection using Oracle PL/SQL dialect. Concatenates strings in two fields then inserts hash into target table. Uses Oracle minus function to diff source and target hash. This is a trivial example as there are only four records of two fields, so wipe-replace would be just as good. However, when dealing with 100,000s of records with 40 fields, the concept may be useful. The limitation of the SQL implementation is the CONCAT function, which is limited to two arguments: column 1 and column 2, so tables with more columns require "nesting" of concat functions, which gets confusing very quickly. The concept may be applied with a high level programming language (Java, Python, others) that have some sort of hashing API. In that case, one would be able to create row objects of differing data types, do the hash, then do the diff.
